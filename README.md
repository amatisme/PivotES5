# Pivot
### NodeJS / AngularJS 1.5.7 / Web Component Library 

Pivot is a library of services, filters and components was built to support ES5 browsers due to legacy software constraints. It was developed as a library of resuable custom controls for use with both On-prem APIs and SaaS APIs. The ES5 constraint meant I had to solve problems already solved by more modern frameworks which was a fantastic challenge including a contentful rich text parser for contentful's custom objects and an attachment uploader for CouchDB.

It is to be used with a companion web application and was initially setup on the Google Cloud Platform but I have ran out of free credits so I am still contemplating setting this up as a payed account. It would mean less fun stuff for my kids so I need to think about it ;) I have left the NodeJS code for connecting to both the Firestore and the Storage. I will upload a companion application soon.

I am also actively updating this into a modern framework, currently evaluating both Polymer and Angular2 in either Dart or Typescript.

Please enjoy reviewing this code, I spent a lot of time on it in a bubble so I fully expect all viewers to find better ways or different aproaches, this is the fun of code right? Go easy on me.
