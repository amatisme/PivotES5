# /component
These AngularJS 1.5.7 web components were built to support ES5 browsers due to legacy software constraints. The current design called a local Node API that connected to a contentful.com account, authorized, then loaded content from a JSON file. This could be setup differently to use Firebase which I may update at a later date.

# /service
This AngularJS 1.5.7 service was built to support ES5 browsers due to legacy software constraints. It handles get requests for spaces, entries and assets. It also includes support for contentful's rich text within custom object.
